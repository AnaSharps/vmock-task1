TASK:   
    - Design a login flow using PHP, HTML and CSS where a user can login, singup and see the dashboard.    
    We were asked to keep the following points in mind:   
   1.  Two types of Users: Normal and Admin
   2. By default a user will signup as a normal user.
   3. On the admin user's dashboard, user will see a list of all the users, he can delete those, change the roles, update the details.
   4. On the normal user's dashboard, a read only list should be present
   5. There should be logout functionality.
